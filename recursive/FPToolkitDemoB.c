This code assumes an underlying X11 environment.

       Most freshly installed unbuntu environments do not have
       the X11 developr stuff they'll need to do graphics.
       To download X11 developer stuff, connect to the internet and
       issue the following two commands.  Each will ask for your password
       and each will take a few minutes.  At some point it might even
       look like nothing is happening....be patient :

sudo  apt-get  install  libx11-dev

sudo  apt-get  install  xorg-dev
